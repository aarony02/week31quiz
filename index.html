<h2>My favorite part of Advance Web</h2>
<p>My favorite part about Patino is that I can 
come here every day and learn something new.
It is very cool to learn new things on how to 
not be as nervous or how to pitch and what 
the future would look like if you wanted to 
start a business. Many people may not know, 
but Patino can help you in a lot of ways with 
life and how to work in the real world with other people.</p>
<h2>My least favorite part of Advanced Web</h2>
<p>My least favorite part of Patino is that 
We don't have a lot of activities on campus. 
Many people don't participate in things on 
our school and especially sports.Also, we 
should have been placed with the people that 
we wanted for our teams sophmore year.</p>
